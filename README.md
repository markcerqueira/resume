Today I am freeing myself from the tyranny of having my résumé in Microsoft Word and updating it.
This résumé was adapted from [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

#### Set Up

1. To set up LaTeX: `brew cask install mactex texmaker` 
1. Open mark-cerqueira-resume.tex in texmaker
1. Use `LuaLaTeX` to run and produce mark-cerqueira-resume.pdf
1. Each section of the resume is stored in separate files in the `resume` folder
